# Interpretable Machine Learning for Diabetic Patient Readmission

Developed an interpretable Machine Learning model to predict if a diabetes patient is going to be re-hospitalized. Also, the factors leading to potential readmission, which could improve the treatment of the patient, were identified using LIME and SHAP in Python.
